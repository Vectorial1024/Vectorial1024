- 🎮 I am a modder, and have created mods for:
  - Cities Skylines
  - RimWorld
  - X: Rebirth
  - X4: Foundations
- 💻 I am a programmer:
  - Backend specialization
  - Substance over presentation, quality over quantity
  - Small and elegant solutions for essential practical problems
  - Every small step shall be confident; every venture shall be well-planned
  - Axioms, lemmas, theorems, proofs, hypotheses, conjectures
